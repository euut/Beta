# Beta (In Progress)

This is my first Java 2D game project called "Beta", built from scratch in Java without using game engines. I just want to learn how to build a game by doing everything manually. That's all there is to it.


## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

> A simple 2D game where the player can move around and shoot...well, POOP...

### ðŸ”§ Features (so far)
- Custom 2D renderer
- Basic player movement
- Collision detection system
- Level generation
- Simple camera system


## ðŸš§ Current Status

This game is still under development. I'm planning to work on:
- Adding enemies and more maps
- Battle & scoring system
- Sound effects
- Game UI, if possible...
